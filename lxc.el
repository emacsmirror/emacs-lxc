;; Some simple tools for dealing with LXC containers in Emacs.

;;; Code:

(defconst lxc/list-command
  "sudo lxc-ls --fancy-format name,state,pid,ipv4 --fancy"
  "The command we use for listing containers.")

(defun lxc/list ()
  "Make the list of containers using `lxc/list-command.'"
  (let ((cmd lxc/list-command))
    (->> (-drop 2 (split-string (shell-command-to-string cmd) "\n"))
      (-filter (lambda (s) (> (length s) 0)))
      (-map (lambda (s)
              (-filter
               (lambda (s) (> (length s) 0))
               (split-string s " ")))))))

(defun lxc/table-entrys ()
  "Make the table entries for `tabulated-list-mode'."
  (-map (lambda (e)
          (list (car e) (apply 'vector e)))
   (lxc/list)))

(define-derived-mode
    lxc-list-table-mode tabulated-list-mode "LXC containers"
    "Major mode for listing your LXC containers."
    (setq tabulated-list-entries 'lxc/table-entrys)
    ;; This is wrong! it needs to be derived from display-time-world-list
    (setq tabulated-list-format
          (loop for col in (list "name" "state" "pid" "IP")
             vconcat (list (list col 20 nil))))
    (tabulated-list-init-header))
